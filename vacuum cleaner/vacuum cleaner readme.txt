How to Use the Simulation
Controls:

Arrow keys: Move the vacuum cleaner (Up/Down for speed, Left/Right for turning)

Space: Toggle cleaning mode

D: Dock to charging station

U: Undock from charging station

S: Start/Stop the vacuum

1-4: Change vacuum cleaner shape

Shapes and Their Advantages:

Circular (Press 1): Excellent maneuverability in tight spaces with 360Â° cleaning capability. Best for rooms with many obstacles.

Rectangular (Press 2): Efficient for straight paths and cleaning along edges and walls. Ideal for rectangular rooms.

Triangular (Press 3): Superior corner cleaning with wide front coverage. Great for rooms with many corners.

D-Shaped (Press 4): Combines the straight edge cleaning of rectangular vacuums with the maneuverability of circular ones. Excellent for getting close to edges.

Features:

Battery indicator that depletes with movement and cleaning

Dust collection counter

Docking station for recharging

Visual cleaning effects based on shape

The simulation demonstrates how each vacuum shape has unique advantages for different cleaning scenarios, allowing you to choose the best shape for specific room layouts and cleaning needs.
